It is completely terrible in places. When this first came out, there was a lot of hype around it since it was omg, m1dy vs killingscum release and then it ended up a bit of a laugh for both of them as fans were wtf&#39;d by the sound. I did talk to Sharpnel about the 音圧愚連隊 and he said anything produced under that name is not &quot;Sharpnel sound&quot; or &quot;m1dy sound&quot; but a &quot;tribute sound&quot; and he laughed. It&#39;s clearly not meant as a serious musical endeavour, but more of an experiment, haha.</div><div id="footer">This 1046-character message would have taken 8 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
