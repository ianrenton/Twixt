This is not a case of either one or the other. The gunmen at <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23CharlieHebdo">#CharlieHebdo</a> wanted to curb free speech and thanks to knee&#45;jerk <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23bigbrother">#bigbrother</a> govt, they are succeeding at doing so far beyond &#39;just&#39; killing satirical cartoonists. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/MI5">@MI5</a> be careful what you wish for. Anyone want to consider the Norwegian <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23Breivik">#Breivik</a> governmental and police response instead? Where is cool headed sanity when we need it?<br>The only way to prevent racism is to show everyone how infantile it is. Martyrdom, posturing and law toughening from either side of the debate does not do that. For a society that professes to be civilised, we are remarkably barbaric both to others and ourselves. I wish not a plague, but a healing of whatever horrible psychological traumas must surely be afflicting both your houses, Western governments and their people and self&#45;proclaimed jihadis alike.</p></div><div id="footer">This 906-character message would have taken 7 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://software.ianrenton.com/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
