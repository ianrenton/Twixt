Remember all OSS licences key off copyright law. So its about what you ship/distribute &#40;however that is defined&#41;, not what actually runs on the HW. It is possible to make closed source software that runs Linux, which of course has to interface with the Kernel, system libs, etc.</p></div><div id="footer">This 355-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://software.ianrenton.com/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
