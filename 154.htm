Your other case is certainly doable though &#45; A sends &quot;@B <a href="http://www.twitter.com/C">@C</a> blah&quot;, B clicks reply, B&#39;s box gets filled with &quot;@A <a href="http://www.twitter.com/C">@C</a>&quot;.</div><div id="footer">This 383-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
