I believe it integrates something like Google Talk, but only the text side of it AFAIK.  Besides, even if it did do voice, GTalk does voice everywhere!  Only reason GVoice isn&#39;t global is that it ties in to the real phone network, it&#39;s not just a web thing.</div><div id="footer">This 289-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
