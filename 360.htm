Feels like I&#39;ve seen every SQL and OS error possible today &#40;including &quot;Error 2: Error not found&quot;&#41; just doing what ought to be a simple job.  When you detach a DB it screws with the OS&#45;level permissions on the files, when you reattach a read&#45;only DB it throws an error but adds a dummy DB anyway, when you delete that dummy DB it throws an error but when you refresh it&#39;s actually deleted it... The list goes on! :D</div><div id="footer">This 495-character message would have taken 4 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
