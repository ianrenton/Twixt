The red thread&#45;lock stuff is designed to stop nuts &amp; bolts slipping. No idea why they&#39;d put it on something user adjustable, or why they&#39;ve put so much of it on! If that is the stuff, you need to heat it up before trying to remove the bolt with tools &#45; there&#39;s a risk that the heat will damage any nearby plastic so it&#39;s not a good idea :&#40;</p></div><div id="footer">This 366-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://software.ianrenton.com/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
