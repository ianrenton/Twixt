To be honest I&#39;d rather find someone to stay with, it&#39;s fine if space is a commodity at yours I&#39;ll see if anyone travelling to/from from Southampton can shove me in a corner for a few nights. Failing that, do you think they&#39;ll let us put a tent in your car park? :D</div><div id="footer">This 413-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
