The abortion &#40;which is correct, but in realityreality, didn&#39;t happen &#45; it&#39;s her way of looking back at it in an artistic way&#41; is symbolic to being dropped by Def Jam, the stabs in the back is the betrayal by Def Jam. After the hospital, she gets taken back to her apartment by her friend. At this point, it flashes white &#40;which would imply now we are in different time setting &#41; and the following scenes occur before the hospital sequence. Here, she gets the call &#40;which is reality and did happen&#41; that she gets dropped and it depicts her reaction to that. The ballerina scenes interspersed throughout represents her creativity that was beginning to shine with Def Jam. But, during her freakout the ballerina dancing becomes increasingly sporadic up until the point where Gaga&#45;ballerina is on the ground in despair looking up at the other ballerinas &#40;the stars she wants to be&#41; until the sequences ends and her creativity is taken away from her, thus no more ballerina. I wouldn&#39;t say the bedazzler scene is when she gets into Tisch &#40;as she was at Tisch before she was signed to Def Jam&#41;, instead she is seen looking up at what&#45;could&#45;be, the stars on the balcony and here she realises she is to do it over again. The car scenes: I believe that the muscle cars are representative of the fakers/Def Jam. As the song begins, she is still in the cars but the song progress and as she &#39;marries the night&#39; the cars a set on fire and she is dancing on top of them &#45; indicating that she has overcome Def Jam and she is in control as she burns Def Jam out of her life. &#40;The dancing scenes really just seem to there to be MTV&#45;friendly and have no real sustenance. You could say she is stronger here having married the night; that&#39;s a bit of a stretch.&#41; The road scene, again more commerically&#45;friendly, perhaps she is joining the New York hustle again &#45; the dance is on a NY bridge, the scene starts by her joining the dancers, representative of her doing the hustle. And of course in the car, true resolve as been acheived as she has one more chance with Interscope records. Closing scenes where she is rising up? Perhaps a big f*ck you to Def Jam.</div><div id="footer">This 2219-character message would have taken 16 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
