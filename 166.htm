One thing I would like to know actually &#40;and you&#39;re probably the quickest way of finding out! =P&#41; what&#39;s the best way of triggering a jQuery function *after* a jQuery element replace has happened?  Mostly here I&#39;m thinking of the fact that I&#39;ve broken your jQ code, because it now triggers before the columns have any content!  I&#39;m going to need to chain it so refexpand.js happens not on document.onLoad but once refresh.js has done its thing.  I can think of several things to try, but you probably know the best way!</div><div id="footer">This 539-character message would have taken 4 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
