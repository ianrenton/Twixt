Link above explains some of the encoded/gzip stuff that&#39;s a little over my head. I could be completely wrong, but elsewhere theres something about a file &quot;log1.txt&quot; in the root/logs folder &#40;which it creates if it is missing&#41; where it picks a random line from it and attempts to retrieve the contents at that url. Is this file a list of urls perhaps? Or does that part just retrieve the page&#39;s normal contents before injecting the code from the encoded sections?</div><div id="footer">This 599-character message would have taken 5 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
