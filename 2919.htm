Did it drag on into two, three, four tweets, cluttering up everyone&#39;s list? Twixt can help.<br><br>Having done just that several times, I was after a simple, disposable way of putting more than 140 characters up somewhere on the internet that I can link from a single tweet. Thus, I created this simple PHP script. Give it a block of text, and it&#39;ll generate you a unique web page and grab you an is.gd short URL for it.<br><br>You can try it out at <a href="http://twixt.successwhale.com">[link]</a>, or download and run it on your own web server.<br><br>If you&#39;d like to run this from your own server, you can get the source code here on GitHub. To run it, you&#39;ll need a web server that can run PHP, and the directory the script sits in must be writable by whatever user you run your web server as.<br><br>API<br>Twixt also provides an API for use by applications such as my own SuccessWhale. To use it, simply provide it with a properly URLEncoded “tweet” argument, for example:<br><br><a href="http://twixt.successwhale.com/index.php?tweet=Hello&#37;20World">[link]</a><br><br>Twixt will return an HTTP 302 redicrect to the text&#45;format output page of is.gd&#39;s “shorten” API, which will be either an HTTP 200 OK containing the shortened URL, or an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error containing the error message.<br><br>If you prefer not to use is.gd, you can also supply the raw parameter with value true, like so:<br><br><a href="http://twixt.successwhale.com/index.php?tweet=Hello&#37;20World&amp;raw=true">[link]</a><br><br>This will return either an HTTP 200 OK containing the URL, or an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error containing the error message. This URL will not be shortened, so it will be based on the path on which you are running twixt, e.g. <a href="http://twixt.successwhale.com/1.htm">[link]</a>. You can then pipe this through a shortening service of your own, if you like.<br><br>Status<br>Twixt is currently at version 1.2.<br><br>Twixt is mature, released software, and as far as I know there are no major bugs that affect it. If you find any bugs or would like to request any new features, please add an issue on GitHub.<br><br>This description is from the GitHub project ianrenton/twixt. Full source code is available there.</p></div><div id="footer">This 2288-character message would have taken 17 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://software.ianrenton.com/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
