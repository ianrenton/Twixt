OTOH CM7 only has a few little bugs for most people, and you might want to skip having to wipe your data twice &#40;stock&#45;&gt;F&#45;&gt;G&#41; and just go straight stock&#45;&gt;G.  If you&#39;re adventurous and can see yourself wanting e.g. CM7 when it gets to Release Candidate &#40;maybe a week or two&#41;, go with CM7 Nightly <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%233">#3</a> now. If you reckon you&#39;d happily stay with Froyo for a few months, go for a Froyo ROM now.</div><div id="footer">This 632-character message would have taken 5 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
