If you want your graph to be perfectly vertical at the edges, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s really possible, but if you could settle for some lesser angle, it would be.  The easiest is probably y = &#40;tan&#40;&#40;x&#45;0.5&#41;*pi/2&#41;/2&#41;&#43;0.5, but that&#39;s a really shallow angle that doesn&#39;t look very curvy at all.</div><div id="footer">This 421-character message would have taken 4 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
