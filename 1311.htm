I&#39;m going to add a checkbox on creation for &quot;let me do yesterday&#39;s&quot;, just so users have something to enter immediately on promise creation to get them hooked.  Time zone noted, will do that.  Clone/multi, maybe once it&#39;s up and running.  Any chance you could stick these in the Github issue tracker before I forget them &#45; I can&#39;t HTTP POST here to do it myself :&#40;</div><div id="footer">This 497-character message would have taken 4 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
