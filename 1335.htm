I&#39;ve had my own web hosting reseller account and tried to have a site that consumes at least 5gb of bw every month &#40;on a shared hosting environment&#41;. It&#39;s not really unlimited as right after I&#39;ve consumed more than 6gb, they cancelled my account. IDK how LinkedIn&#39;s API works, never tried it. I have a CDN with maxcdn/netdna, they gave it to me for free, so I could use the CDN service to rehost the files so the site would load much faster and stuff. Also currently on a cloud hosting environment, so I could help out with the hosting. :&#41;</div><div id="footer">This 596-character message would have taken 5 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
