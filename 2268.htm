But Vueling&#39;s website has direct LHR&#45;LCG flights &#40;though they&#39;re not online yet for when we want to travel&#41; while Iberia/BA no longer seem to offer the route &#40;though they do have their flights available for when we want to travel&#41;. Maybe Vueling is a proper separate airline now that bought that route?</div><div id="footer">This 477-character message would have taken 4 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
