The service that they give you, even for the lowest plan is wayyy better than what you get with some other hosters, like, HostGator / Dreamhost. 4 CPU cores being shared to up to 40 512 linodes is a lot of savings, unlike any other hosters that&#39;s overselling. </div><div id="footer">This 355-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
