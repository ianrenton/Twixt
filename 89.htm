If it&#39;s more and people who signed up get invites to give out, then sure!  If it&#39;s less, though, ISTR we had to sign up using Google accounts, so they may not be transferable.</div><div id="footer">This 352-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
