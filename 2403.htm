Technically we don&#39;t know &#40;how fast do warps in space&#45;time travel? This is technically what gravity is&#41; but GR generally posits that gravity is limited to travelling at the speed of light. There&#39;s some hypoteses that put it travelling slightly slower than the speed of light, but your mileage may vary on their verification.</div><div id="footer">This 385-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
