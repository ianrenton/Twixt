Best approach: create feature items in Mantis before doing something, so others can see what you are going to do. And please ask any many questions about stuff as you like. I am always available on email, google talk, etc. collaboration suggestions welcome!</div><div id="footer">This 409-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
