Just wondering, this weekend would it be easier to drop my stuff at your house Friday morning &#40;coach is due in at 11 but I can appear later if ness.&#41; or shall I arrange to leave it in someone&#39;s car so I&#39;m out of the way? Both ways would be fine for me &#40;I did ask Ian but apparently he&#39;s banished from the house!&#41; :&#41;</div><div id="footer">This 337-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
