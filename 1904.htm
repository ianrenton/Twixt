It autogenerated a get method for it, but not a set method, and I couldn&#39;t figure out why. The internet informs me that it was a design decision, and if I have a list I want to give to the class, I should getList&#40;&#41; and add each element one by one.</div><div id="footer">This 364-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
