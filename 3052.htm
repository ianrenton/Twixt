In terms of speed and security it&#39;s miles ahead of Wordpress, and theming is a little easier as it uses Sass. There are some good community themes/plugins but 10s not 1000s. It&#39;s easy once you know the workflow but a hassle for the setup/first few posts.</p></div><div id="footer">This 382-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://software.ianrenton.com/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
