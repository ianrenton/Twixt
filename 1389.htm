My original plan &#40;dumbphone&#43;tablet&#41; would have required me to pretty much carry it around everywhere and having played with one it&#39;s a little too big for that. If you&#39;re only after occasional use for entertainment, I&#39;d say 9&#45;10in is probably the sweet spot. I&#39;ve only played around with iPads in that size range, but Android tablets at that size are available.</div><div id="footer">This 468-character message would have taken 4 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
