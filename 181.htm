It could just be the cable that&#39;s broken.  Failing that, turn off the speakers and open them up, check inside for obvious broken wires or any components surrounded by brown gunk &#40;they&#39;ve exploded&#41;.  If a wire&#39;s come off a circuit board and you can see where it belongs, you can solder it back.  If a component&#39;s blown, see if you feel confident identifying it, buying a replacement and replacing it.  Otherwise, it&#39;s time for a multimeter/oscilloscope and lots of patience, checking all the terminals you can get access to.</div><div id="footer">This 583-character message would have taken 5 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
