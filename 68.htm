Twitter supporting them would be a godsend, but unlikely &#45; I&#39;m sure Twitter devs want it to stay simple, rather than turning into Yet Another Social Network.  &#40;And in part, I agree.&#41;  Only client I know that does it is TweetDeck, they store friendgroups in their own DB, matched up to your TD account.  Obviously that means it&#39;s not portable between TD and future group&#45;supporting clients, a pain if you have a complex setup.  Implementing a format for friendgroups isn&#39;t actually too hard &#45; the problem for SW is this:  Once you have group&#45;based columns, you don&#39;t know how many Twitter pages you have to go back in order to fill all the columns.  The Twitter API isn&#39;t fast, so trawling back on every update isn&#39;t feasible.  And the only way around that is caching &#45; not a problem in desktop clients, but a very big one for SuccessWhale!</div><div id="footer">This 860-character message would have taken 7 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
