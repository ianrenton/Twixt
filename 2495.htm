I thought that as the GPIO header had a 5v supply they might have been friendly to MAX232 users and made the UART run on 5v too, but clearly not! I think from looking at the positions of the regulators on the board that the 5v in from the microUSB probably just goes to the one 5v pin on the header and to the USB host ports, probably nowhere else.</div><div id="footer">This 377-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
