Whoops.&#41;  Not sure what constitutes a &quot;data service&quot; that&#39;s banned.  I&#39;ve never done any kind of P2P/Torrenting on it, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want to do that on 3G anyway!  The most intensive things I do on 3G are occasional video podcast downloads when I forget to do it on WiFi before I go out, and Last.fm streaming.  IM, FTP, SSH, VNC etc. all seem to be allowed out from the phone.  Suspect the contract also bans tethering but I&#39;ve played with it &#40;minor tethered browsing&#41; without complaint.</div><div id="footer">This 545-character message would have taken 4 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
