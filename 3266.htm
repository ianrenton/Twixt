But if you have a Gender Recognition Certificate, it&#39;s against the law for anyone who knows you have one to reveal your previous identity. This means companies like the university should not hold any records in the old name unless they are held securely, and anything public e.g. degree details should be in the new name. Maybe dragging the law in will help them change their mind! &#40;Usual caveat, not a lawyer &#45; maybe there&#39;s a charity/website for transgender issues that may have proper legal advice?&#41;</p></div><div id="footer">This 596-character message would have taken 5 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://software.ianrenton.com/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
