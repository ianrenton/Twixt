If you have no other loans and enough savings, and you&#39;ve still got money you don&#39;t know what to do with, paying off some in advance isn&#39;t a bad plan. </p></div><div id="footer">This 371-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://software.ianrenton.com/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
