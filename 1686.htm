We basically have the same feature set as TweetDeck at this point, and I can&#39;t see Twitter shutting them off.  I should probably go and look up &quot;CRM&quot;, I don&#39;t really know what it means! :&#41;</div><div id="footer">This 454-character message would have taken 4 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
