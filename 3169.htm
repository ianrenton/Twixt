It sounds like they&#39;re trying to replace the Web of trust system, which is frankly dangerous. Building a WoT is a hassle and the hardest part of PGP, however it&#39;s a guarantee that people are trusted because you can only sign with your private key. Keybase looks like it&#39;s trying to build a parallel WoT without that guarantee, so your keybase WoT can be manipulated by keybase or someone who cracks their servers. </p></div><div id="footer">This 484-character message would have taken 4 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://software.ianrenton.com/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
