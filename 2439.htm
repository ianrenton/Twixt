I cannot fathom the mind that thought &quot;when we receive an integer larger than 2^32, shall we treat it as a 64&#45;bit integer? Oh no, better idea, let&#39;s silently convert it to floating point, &#39;cos no&#45;one needs *exact* integers greater than 2^32. Oh, and when we convert that float to a string, let&#39;s always give it in exponential notation. Yeah, no way that can cause problems.&quot;</div><div id="footer">This 413-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
