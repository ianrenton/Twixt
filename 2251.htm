If you mean evolutionary origins, I&#39;m not sure it has any &#45; it&#39;s certainly not going to be selected for in cold aquatic environments, as cold shock regularly causes drowning and cardiac arrest.  There&#39;s an evolutionary trait called the mammalian dive reflex &#40;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_diving_reflex&#41">[link]</a>; which is almost the opposite of the cold shock reaction that is a survival trait.  There is some research &#40;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8765994&#41">[link]</a>; showing that repeated cold shocks increase the brain&#39;s ability to keep control over the body during them, reducing the risk of a gasp.  Cold shock definitely happens when body parts other than the face enter cold water.
