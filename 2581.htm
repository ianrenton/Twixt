Are there differences between this and normal matter? Is this why antimatter and normal matter annihilate each other? Is it as paradox when they meet? If antimatter can be held for a while in a magnetic field, can matter be sent back in an anti magnetic field? Is it not where all the antimatter went, but when? Does this help to explain the nature of the Big Bang? Is temporal decay the reason more matter survived than antimatter?</div><div id="footer">This 488-character message would have taken 4 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
