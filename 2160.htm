All I wanted to do was use a drive already full of data as half of a new RAID 1 with an identical but empty and unformatted drive. I have tried setting it up using mdadm because I didn&#39;t know Ubuntu&#39;s GUI Disk Utility could do it for me and now I can&#39;t get either a RAID array or individual disks to show up in gnome or to mount via terminal. ARGH! Help. </div><div id="footer">This 411-character message would have taken 3 tweets!<br>Your sanity was restored by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/twixt">Twixt</a>.</div></div></body></html>
